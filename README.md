# Web Portal Development Task

## Description
I have found that for this task, none of the frameworks are required. Thus, I used a simple approach with two files: one PHP and another HTML. The `index.html` file serves basic functions such as displaying a table, implementing search functionality, and loading a modal to display images from the local system.

## Files
- `index.html`: HTML file containing the main structure, JavaScript's client-side logic and basic CSS styles for the web page.
- `api.php`: PHP file for handling server-side logic and making API calls.

## Features
- Displaying a table of data fetched from an API.
- Implementing search functionality to filter table rows.
- Opening a modal to select and display images from the local file system.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Use the search input to filter table rows based on the provided query.
4. Click the "Select Image" button to open the modal and choose an image from your local file system.
